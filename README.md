# Graph Analytics Project

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a large dataset using graph analytics in R. The dataset, `socEpinions.tsv`, consists of relationships that are visualized and analyzed to extract meaningful insights about nodes, edges, and their relationships.

## Objectives
- **Graph Creation and Simplification:** Convert data into graph format, simplify it, and identify significant clusters.
- **Graph Analytics Functions:** Apply various graph analytics functions to extract insights like node centrality, edge density, longest paths, and ego networks.
- **Visualization:** Create meaningful plots to visualize the relationships in the graph and the extracted insights.

## Project Components
### 1. `Graph_Analytics_Docn.pdf`
Comprehensive documentation detailing the steps taken throughout the project, including data preprocessing, graph creation, graph simplification, and application of various graph analytics functions. The document contains all code snippets and their corresponding outputs.

### 2. `graph-analytics.R`
The R script that contains the source code for the project. It demonstrates how to load the dataset, create and manipulate graphs using the `igraph` package, and apply various functions to analyze the graph structure.

### 3. `pics`
Contains visualizations and screenshots showing the analysis performed throughout the project. These visuals include plots of the graphs, histograms, adjacency matrices, and more.

### 4. `socEpinions.tsv`
The dataset used in this project. It contains the relationships to be analyzed, formatted as tab-separated values.

## Graph Analytics Techniques
- **Graph Creation:** Conversion of the dataset to a graph using `igraph` functions.
- **Graph Simplification:** Techniques to simplify the graph by computing clusters, contracting vertices, and removing vertices with low degrees.
- **Graph Metrics:** Calculation of key metrics like node and edge density, centrality measures, and diameter.
- **Network Analysis:** Identification of central nodes, longest paths, largest cliques, ego networks, and power centrality.

## Lessons Learned
- **R and `igraph` Package:** Introduction to R and advanced usage of the `igraph` package for graph analytics.
- **Data Handling:** Handling and analyzing large datasets in R, converting them into graphs, and applying graph theory.
- **Graph Analytics:** Application and interpretation of graph analytics functions to extract meaningful insights from the graph.
- **Collaboration:** The project provided insights into effective collaboration and project management among team members.

## Conclusion
This project offered a comprehensive learning experience in graph analytics, covering everything from data handling and visualization to advanced analytics and collaboration skills. The practical applications of graph theory showcased in this project are valuable in various real-world scenarios.
